1. Feasibilityâ€‹:

	Yes, upto some extend we can find video source based on metadata and it's content. But, it's quite time consuming. We can automate 	this by doing multiple parallel content investigating process.

2. Methodology:

	VIDEO - Provenance:

		Hyperlink Investigation
		other TAGS information for an ex., Artist, Title, Year, Rating, Director, Writer, URLS, Publisher, etc..
		Diital Copy Right

	Content Investiation:

		Image Search (using common web search engines)
		TinyEye (Reverse Image Search)

		Audio Language (Audio - Processing) to get to know (language, accent) of the content to locate "geography".

		Image content Investigate First and last 1 min of Video Content to get to know precise location of the video content. 				ex., (License Plate, advertising Poster, etc.,)

		OCR in image to extract text.

		Based on the available information search in specified country search engine using VPN to get relevant results.

		Amnesty International tool will be an other choice.

3. Challenges:
	Most of videos don't have proper metadata. so, mostly we should go with content investigation.
	It's quite time consuming.
